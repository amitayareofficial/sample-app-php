This is a sample website written in PHP 7 using [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework and [Kentico Kontent Delivery SDK for PHP](https://github.com/Kentico/kontent-delivery-sdk-php). You can register your Kontent account for free at [https://app.kontent.ai](https://app.kontent.ai).

## Application setup

Before you can run the app, make sure your environment is set up correctly with [PHP 7+](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) and the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) package manager installed.

* For Windows, see how to [configure Visual Studio Code for PHP pevelopment](https://github.com/Kentico/kontent-delivery-sdk-php/wiki/Developing-PHP-in-Visual-Studio-Code-for-Dummies).
* For Linux distrubutions, see how to [configure PHP Storm for PHP development](https://github.com/Kentico/kontent-delivery-sdk-php/wiki/Configuring-PHP-Storm-on-Linux).

Once these prerequisites are met, you can run the application as follows:

1. Clone this repository.
1. In your command line, navigate to the project folder.
1. Run `composer install` to install dependencies.
1. (Optional) Run `composer run prepare-environment` to create a sample [Laravel environment file](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/configuration#environment-configuration).
1. Run `php artisan serve` to run the sample app.

The app is now running locally at [`127.0.0.1:8000`](127.0.0.1:8000) (default) and you can open it in your browser.

Alternatively, you can also deploy your application to your Apache server  by cloning the repository, running `composer install`, and accessing corresponding address on your server.

### Connecting your project

This sample website displays content from a Sample Project that demonstrates Kentico Kontent features and best practices. This fully featured project contains marketing content for Dancing Goat â€“ an imaginary chain of coffee shops. By default, this sample website uses a shared project where the content remains constant for everyone.

You can change the source Kentico Kontent project to your own project to be able to change the content. If you don't have your own Sample Project, any admin of a Kentico Kontent subscription [can generate one](https://kontent.ai/learn/tutorials/manage-kontent/projects/manage-projects#a-create-a-sample-project).

When you have a Sample Project, follow these steps to connect it to this sample app:

1. In Kentico Kontent, choose Project settings from the app menu.
1. Under Development, choose API keys.
1. Copy your Project ID.
1. In the sample app folder, open the `app\Providers\AppServiceProvider.php` file.
1. At the bottom, find the line that ends with `new DeliveryClient('975bf280-fd91-488c-994c-2f04416e5ee3');`.
1. Replace `975bf280-fd91-488c-994c-2f04416e5ee3` with the ID of your Sample Project.
1. Save the file.

Now when you run the sample application, content is retrieved from your project.

```

## Content administration
